Carlvin is data science enthusiast mainly interested in analytics & visualization, financial modelling and predictive analytics in machine learning.

As a quant analyst, he develops and tests existing to new models for financial markets analysis and reporting. Au courant with the vastly growing technology space and it's use in the financial sector, he constantly seeks to up-skill his expertise in the use of applied Statistics through the **R** and **PYTHON** programming languages, bundled with functional programming in **F#** for package development for the **.Net** framework integration.

In the night, he performs random data analysis and visualization to extract meaningful insights while exploring different statistical concepts and their applications in real world problems.

On this blogsite you will find some of his research work in posts, talks presented as well as personal data science projects. Feel free to read, comment or offer new suggestions or educate.
